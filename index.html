        <h1>Phil Dysert</h1>
        <p>"I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes. 
			You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men
			who were with me. 
			In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help 
			the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 'It 
			is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</p>
